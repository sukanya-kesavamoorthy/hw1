2) $(document).ready vs window.onload?

$(document).ready is the jQuery event and it will run the code when the HTML is all ready, it doesn't wait for the images and otherthing to load
It is used when there are many images,scripts etc to load without wasting time on loading
if there are changes to be made further in the pages then this is used.

window.onload is used when everything is loaded including images, scripts etc
It is used when there are smaller files to load 
It is used when there are no changes to be made to the page.
