selects the elements which have the specified value in a attribute as a substring

selects the elements which have the specified value in a attribute after a space

3.Attribute contains selector[name^="value"]
selects the elements which have the specified value in a attribute as a starting letter or starting with that

4.Attribute contains selector[name$="value"]
