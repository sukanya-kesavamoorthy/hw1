1) explain about arr.forEach and arr.map . compare the differences?







2) object and object methods (.hasOwnProperty(item))

In Javascript an object is a collection of properties and property is the combinaton of key and value. they both are seperated by ba colon and
key should be only string whereas value can be any javascript datatype.

3) diff ways of creating an object
The object in javascript can be creted in different methods. They are:
first method:Assgning a value to a variable is nothing but creating an object.

<script>
var office = "Federal";
document.write(office);
</script>

second method: when there are multiple values then

<script>
var office = {
    name : "federal",
    domain: "UI",
    time    : 3,
    
};

document.write(office.name + " " + "is giving " + office.domain +" " + "training from" + office.time + " " + "months");
</script>

Third method: By using a keyword new you can create an object.
By using the above example but using keyword new.

<script>
var office = new Object();
office.name = "federal";
office.domain = "UI";
office.time = 3;
    

document.write(office.name + " " + "is giving " + office.domain +" " + "training from" + office.time + " " + "months");
</script>

Fourth method:
The other method of creating object is by using constructor. while using constructor we use "this" in the object as the substitute for the new object.
It doesnt have any value assigned just used as a substitute

<script>

function office(n, d, t){

this.name = n;
this.domain = d;
this.time = t;

}
    
var sukanya = new office("Federal", "UI",3 );
var vinithra = new office("Federal", "SQL", 4);

document.write("sukanya is learning " + sukanya.domain + " vinithra is learning  " + vinithra.domain);
</script>

4) understand about properties in object. look into about adding property, delete a property, edit property value, check if a property exists?

Adding property:
syntax: object.propertykey= "value";

<script>
var office = {
    name : "federal",
    domain: "UI",
    time    : 3,
    
};

office.area = "Arkansas"

document.write(office.name + " " + "is giving " + office.domain +" " + "training from" + office.time + " " + "months in " + office.area );
</script>



Delete a property: By using delete key word the property can be deleted. By delete keyword both the key and value are deleted.
syntax: delete object.propertykey;


<script>
var office = {
    name : "federal",
    domain: "UI",
    time    : 3,
    
};

delete office.time;

document.write(office.name + " " + "is giving " + office.domain +" " + "training from " + office.time + " " + " months");
</script>


editing a property: 
syntax: object.propertykey="value";

var office = {
    name : "federal",
    domain: "UI",
    time    : 3,
    
};

 office.time = 4;

document.write(office.name + " " + "is giving " + office.domain +" " + "training from " + office.time + " " + " months");
</script>

To check whether the property exists or not
syntax:objectName.hasOwnProperty('propertyKey');
if exists then true else false.

<script>

var office = {
    name : "federal",
    domain: "UI",
    time    : 3,
    
};
document.write(office.hasOwnProperty('name'));

5) what is prototype in object

In javascript every object is referred as prototype. All the objects inherit the properties and mehods from their prototye.
while creating new objects they inherit from a prototype called object. prototype.
creating a prototye in a standard way is by using object constructor function. in the 3rd question we have used an example for creating a object using constructor.
In that the office function ia an prototype and by using new keyword we are creating new objects from the same prototype office.

<script>

function office(n, d, t){

this.name = n;
this.domain = d;
this.time = t;

}
    
var sukanya = new office("Federal", "UI",3 );
var vinithra = new office("Federal", "SQL", 4);

document.write("sukanya is learning " + sukanya.domain + " vinithra is learning  " + vinithra.domain);
</script>


we can also add new properties to the existing prototype. that is by using object.prototype.property.

<script>

function office(n, d, t){

this.name = n;
this.domain = d;
this.time = t;

}
office.prototype.area = "Arkansas" ;
 
var sukanya = new office("Federal", "UI",3 );
var vinithra = new office("Federal", "SQL", 4);

document.write("sukanya is learning " + sukanya.domain + " in " + sukanya.area + "and  vinithra is learning  " + vinithra.domain);
</script>
